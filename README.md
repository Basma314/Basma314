## 📝 Course Assignments & Reflections

### 1. Video Blog to UTM Digital Day 🎬
* **Summary:** What a memorable day! Vibrant, full of good vibes and insightful interactions. Thanks to this assignment, my group and I had the honour of exploring how UTM is embracing digital transformation. All the various talks delivered by the biggest names in the Tech Industry as well as their interactive booth educated us on the latest technology in the field and what our future selves could look like pursuing our desired careers.
* **Reflections:** Personally, I was most impressed by the interactive features at the Microsoft Malaysia booth, specifically their expert systems integrated into CCTV and security infrastructures. It was a powerful example of AI serving a positive purpose, and it has inspired me to continue my journey toward becoming an AI Ethicist who advocates for technology that truly protects and serves society.

### 2. Poster on Industry Talk 1 📜
* **Summary:** This week, my team (Group 9) and I gained the experience of interacting with miscellaneous multimedia and graphics tools and platforms for the sake of designing a poster on the informative Industry Talk 1. To some of us, this was a brand new experience. To others, including myself, it was further practice for our skills in design and multimedia. Designing this poster collaboratively with my team while reflecting on our valuable takes from the talk, was a truly enjoyable time!
* **Reflections:** What was new to me, however, was the insight I got into the field of Data Analytics, Infrastructure and SAP. Most interestingly, what a day in a data analyst's life could look like as shared by the esteemed staff of PPG.

### 3. PC Assemble (Lab) 🖥️
* **Summary:** I gained hands-on experience by completely disassembling a PC and carefully putting it back together, ensuring all hardware components like the motherboard, RAM, and power supply were correctly seated and connected.
* **Reflections:** It was interesting to see the physical side of computers; it made me realize that even the most advanced AI depends on these real, physical parts working correctly. It also helped me ground the concepts I had learnt theoretically from my course: Information and Technology System.

### 4. Academic Writing on Industry Talk 2 📑
* **Summary:** In an elaborate and interactive session, we discussed the Agile and Waterfall software development methodologies, alongside many other relevant concepts in the field of Project Management and System Development. This informative talk was delivered by the experienced Head of Technology and Innovation at Serunai Commerce Sdn Bhd: TS.HJ.Abdul Alim Bin Abdul Muttalib, whom had also generously shared with us his experience from the moment of graduation until his respected position today. Greatly relating to his story and background, we gained the courage to work harder and become more aware of the need to keeping up with the industry's skill demands and realities.
* **Reflections:** Industry talk 2 changed my view to computer science. It made me realize that it is not just about computers but about solving problems in any field. I plan to create meaningful impact across diverse industries by aligning my studies at UTM with the latest market demands.

### 5. Design Thinking 🧠
* **Summary:** For our final Design Thinking project at Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, my team and I tackled a common challenge on campus: transportation efficiency. We proposed and designed the Modern UTM Bus Navigation System, an interface-only prototype aimed at transforming the daily commute for people across campus. Through this collaboration, we moved beyond theoretical learning to successfully applying user-centric design and analytical problem-solving.
* **Reflections:** On a personal level, I truly valued how this project strengthened the bond between my teammates and me, turning it from a complex assignment into a rewarding shared journey. This project challenged my creativity and pushed me to think deeply about how empathetic design can directly improve the mental well-being and daily logistics of those around us.
